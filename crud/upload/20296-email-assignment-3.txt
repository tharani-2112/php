First of all in my opinion life is like a beautiful unpredictable journey that we have been gifted from god. No one knows that what was happened before our birth and what is going to happen after our death. In that journey everyone are running around time. Time is very precious and very much important one in every one's life. I am kind of person who thinks about my future growth and my success. My success is when I am confidently doing my best without any delay. I usually consider my success is learning something new and applying it practically every day.

Now coming to the topic as like I mentioned time is very precious and very much important for me. So, I usually do not postpone my work. Because if I postpone my work it is not only a cause for an organisation but also spoil my future goals and success. If I postponed my work it will be a burden for me to do lots of work it reduces my interest on that work. I am kind of enthisiastic person. Because being enthusiast will inspire myself as well as make my work to complete as soon as possible without delay. So that there will be no problem for organization as well as there is no need for me to spend extra time to complete the work.

My only intention is to do every work properly without delay and to be a kind of enthusiastic and to become a successful person in my career.
